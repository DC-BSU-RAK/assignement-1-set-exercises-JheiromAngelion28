        <p>Guitar players are the ones who put emotion and feel into the instrument. 
        The guitar is one of the most expressive instruments, so much that each guitar player 
        sounds different and plays differently from one another. If you want to have 
        a great tone or playing style, you need to practice with the correct approach while being aware 
        of what your instrument can do.</p>
